I started writing seriously at age thirteen after one of my favorite movie series (How to Train Your Dragon) came to a tragic end. I was a huge fan of the movies growing up, and if you’ve watched the last one (no spoilers here), you can probably imagine the devastation I was feeling.

I spent many days and nights pondering how to fix the broken characters and create a new resolve, but keeping the stories in my head just wasn’t helping. I occasionally considered writing them down, but I denied the option several times; writing wasn’t new to me. I’d typed up a few small stories before—few of which I ever finished.

Nevertheless, the day came when I finally broke down and created a Google Docs file. And that was when it hit me. As I typed a conversation between my characters and felt them come to life under my fingertips, the realization struck me like never before—I loved writing, and I wanted to be an author.
This resulted in my first completed novel, which, if you can believe it, was a How to Train Your Dragon/Transformers crossover! I may never have published it, but my family loved it, I loved it, and it became a big hit in the household reads. So much so that I wrote two more books in the series and made it a trilogy.

Between these ‘fanfiction’ books,’ you might call them, my writing grew, and I began creating stories wrought from my own imagination. But it wasn’t until I opened my first Jeff Wheeler book that I hit an exciting turn in my writing. My mom recommended him to me and bought me a copy of the first book of Whispers from Mirrowen, which, to this day, is still my favorite. Over time, I learned from Jeff Wheeler on a writing basis and incorporated some of his techniques into my own stories, things I never expanded on in my old books. Naturally, I became a fan and joined his newsletter.

My writing began with sadness, with the ashes left over from my favorite childhood story. But like a burned forest, I needed those ashes to grow a better environment and repair what I saw as broken. Despite the somewhat bold method I chose, the How to Train Your Dragon/Transformers trilogy remains my greatest joy as an author, not just because it was the genesis of my authorship, but because it was the genesis of the greatest story God ever wrote me: my story. Since then, my ultimate goal in writing has been to tell fun, inspirational, and emotional stories that will make you either laugh or cry. Overall, I want to make my audience feel and be as passionate about my stories as I was about How to Train Your Dragon. When I’m not writing, I enjoy hiking mountain trails and listening to instrumental music—preferably Epic Score or Audiomachine. As of today, I’m working on my latest and longest project, which I plan to publish in 2025. The working title is “The Last Sparkling,” and I’ll be announcing its release via my blog, so stay tuned!

Best wishes!
