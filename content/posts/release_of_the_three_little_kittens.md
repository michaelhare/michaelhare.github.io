I am proud to announce my debut story, *The Three Little Kittens.* It was just published on Amazon.com tonight and should be available in 72 hours or more. Naturally, I’m pretty excited about this; *The Three Little Kittens* is my first published work, besides the minor submissions I made to Reedsy.com. In light of its distribution, I hope *The Three Little Kittens* impacts readers from all walks of life and brings them together. I can see it clearly in my mind—a group of people, all huddled in front of a glowing fireplace to read and make a memory; that is my hope for this story and all to come after.
