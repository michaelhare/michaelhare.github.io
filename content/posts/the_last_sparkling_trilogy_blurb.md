Here is a ‘trilogy blurb’ for all The Last Sparkling books. Each one will have its own plot, but overall, this covers all three (well, hopefully three—I haven’t worked everything out that far.). Currently, I am about 85% through the first draft of Bonded, book one of The Last Sparkling.

---

Long ago, seven extraordinary thieves obtained the power of the Iyishhräll in an attempt to pilfer its magic. As a result, they became bonded with the children of the dragon monarchs. For this heinous crime, they were thus despised by the dragons. But when a mysterious evil threatens, the dragons realize that they need these seven humans. Filled with a new passion for protecting the dragon race, the former thieves opposed this evil, riding through the skies upon their bonded dragons. The great war cost them everything: blood, anguish, and in the end, their lives.

Now, four hundred years later, that evil has reawakened and those heroes are long past. But there is another. Can the lowly village boy Ayden Ejgard and his bonded dragon be the heroes that his ancestors were?
