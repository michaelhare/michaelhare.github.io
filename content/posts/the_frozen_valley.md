Please enjoy this short scene, starring two characters who are long past during the events of my epic fantasy book. However, there are a few things to keep in mind as you read. One: the fulx are an evil, twisted race of creatures who feast on fear and have a habit of feezing dragons. Two: ‘sparkling’ is the technical term for a dragon rider, who, when bonded with a dragon, can overpower the fulx. Sparklings control a magical fire, whereas fulx control a magical ice.

Dawn winked over the eastern summit, igniting Eiyèmbr’s scales so that he became a beacon of vermillion fire. We have arrived, my Bonded, the dragon said.

Fairama stood between Eiyèmbr’s broad shoulders, keeping her width aligned with the sharp vertebrae of his spine. We should land there, she said, sending the location’s image through the mind gate. With a rumble, Eiyèmbr agreed and banked, beating the air with his wings.

A vein of frozen dragons lay below, caked within the tight embrace of a valley. The scene was barely distinguishable among the snowy trees, but the fulx themselves gave it away. Strange, disproportionate shapes crawled through the white aisles, feasting on the fear of their victims.

So Rithor’s scouts had been correct after all—the fulx were leaking into southern terrain.

Critters scattered as Fairama and Eiyèmbr alit on the valley’s rim; from their view, the dragons seemed to stretch forever. *I cannot hear my brothers and sisters within the ice, Eiyèmbr said, his tail twitching irritably and splashing up snow. Alas, it saddens me to behold them in such a state.*

Fairama dismounted her dragon and landed in a squat. Iyishhräll burst from her Fairy Steel armor, lapping from the greaves, cuirass, vambraces, and other pieces, leaving her leather garments unscathed. At times like this, she felt wholly unified with her power, as if her magic wasn’t indestructible, but she. Sucking in a breath, Fairama closed the distance between her and the scarp of the valley, beholding the misery below.

“*Hasha…*” she hissed, counting the number of frozen dragons. It wouldn’t be easy to free them all, but she had no choice. For what purpose did the fulx torture dragons? Was it simply for the taste of fear? No. Fairama suspected the fulx had a darker intent; their victims were too specific. Why dragons? Why only them?

Sensing her thoughts, Eiyèmbr flexed his talons into the snow and said, *You are right to question, Fairama. Though Torin believes the fulx to be mindless beasts, their behavior is blatantly coordinated. Even the lion toggles between meats, unlike the fulx—their prey is dragons and dragons alone.*

“Perhaps,” said Fairama, remembering the dismissive wave of her superior’s hand, “but Torin never considers my words. If anything, he openly ignores them.” The leader of the sparklings was as adamant as he was powerful, and the only soul capable of swaying him was Glaz.

Comfort rushed from Eiyèmbr’s side of the bond, suffusing Fairama with newfound morale. *I will always believe you, my sparkling, even if all others turn away. Look beside you, and I shall always be there.*

Fairama put a hand on Eiyèmbr’s leg, causing his eyes to blaze gold. *I have no doubt, my dragon, she said, letting a weary smile lift her cheeks. Somehow, you never let me regret stealing from the king and queen of dragons.*

Eiyèmbr chuckled deep in his throat and said nothing else. He was the eldest of Rithor and Sifarath’s children and far more reserved than his sister Glaz.

Fairama gave Eiyèmbr a final pat. *I love you too, old man.*
